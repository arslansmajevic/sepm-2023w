This repository is my SEPM Project, Einzelphase, 2023W. 
This repository should serve as a guideline for all wanting to survive the first phase of this LVA. 
Keep mind, that however good you write your code, or your application good works, some subjective tutor will rip you off.

Try your best to implement the features as precisely as possible.
